# AgriculturalEmissionPrediction

Agriculture has always been an important economic factor for any country
that is causing emissions every day without realizing how much it is leading
towards increasing GHG. Agricultural emissions have been
forecasted for Malaysia to have a better understanding and to take measures
right away. This can be done through a machine learning model including
collecting data, pre-processing, training, building a model, and testing the
model for accuracy. This project aims to develop a model to forecast
agricultural emissions using the three most accurate forecasting models. The time
series analysis consists of three models, autoregressive integrated moving
average(ARIMA), long short-term memory(LSTM), and simple linear
regression model. This model illustrates the forecasted upward trend values
until 2040 in Malaysia.
